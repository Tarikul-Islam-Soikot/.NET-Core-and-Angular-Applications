Hello There!!
I have used .NET Core 3.0, Angular 8.0.0 and Visual Studio 2019.
At the very first time the project will take few seconds to start. If it get any time out error, you have to refresh the opening page. I have added a screenshot after populating data in my grid. Solution is in PostFeedBack folder. There is nothing about database connection as I have prepared data in my PostController. I have written LINQ method syntax to get data in required format. Please run "npm install" command in the ClientApp folder after downloading this Project. Thank you.
